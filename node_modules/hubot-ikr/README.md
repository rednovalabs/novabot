hubot-ikr listens for adverb-phrases that commonly convey enthusiasm, and
responds by validating the shit out of them.

## Installation

I'm working on getting this npm'd. Once I'm done, you'll be able to: 

Run the following command to install this module as a Hubot dependency

```
$ npm install hubot-ikr --save
```

Add **hubot-ikr** to your `external-scripts.json` (you may need to create this file).
```
  ["hubot-ikr"]
```
