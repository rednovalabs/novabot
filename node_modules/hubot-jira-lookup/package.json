  "readme": "# Jira Issue lookup script for Hubot\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd the package `hubot-jira-lookup` as a dependency in your Hubot `package.json` file.\n\n\t\"dependencies\": {\n\t\t\"hubot-jira-lookup\": \"git://github.com/jivesoftware/hubot-jira-lookup.git\"\n\t}\n\nRun the following command to make sure the package is installed.\n\n\t$ npm install\n\nTo enable the script, add the `hubot-jira-lookup` entry to the `external-scripts.json` file (you may need to create this file, if it is not present or if you upgraded from Hubot < 2.4).\n\n\t[\"hubot-jira-lookup\"]\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can run this script in simple mode, which will only return a link to JIRA issue. It's usable in cases like: your JIRA instance is behind company firewall and Hubot instance it's outside. Or you just want such kind of behaviour. To enable this mode just set `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_SIMPLE=true`. Please note, that due to the lack of real conection to the JIRA it won't check if issue really exists.\n\nIn other case - there are three configuration values required for full jira-lookup to work properly.\n\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_USERNAME`\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_PASSWORD`\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_URL`\n\nThere are also optional configuration values.\n\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_INC_DESC` - allows you to include 'Y' or exclude 'N' the description field from the jira report. (default to 'Y')\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_MAX_DESC_LEN` - allows you to display only the first 'x' characters from the description field\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_IGNORE_USERS` - allows you to ignore messages from pre-defined users. Default is to ignore from users named \"jira\" and \"github\", casing is ignored.\n* `HUBOT_JIRA_LOOKUP_TIMEOUT` - allows you to set the time, in minutes, between mentions of a specific ticket in a specific channel/room. Defaults to 15 minutes\n* `HUBOT_SLACK_INCOMING_WEBHOOK` - allows you to output responses formatted as [Slack Attachments](https://api.slack.com/docs/attachments).\n",
